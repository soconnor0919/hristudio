### Initial Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`
3. Run `docker-compose up -d` for local services
4. Run `bun install` to install dependencies
5. Run `bun db:migrate` to set up the database
6. Run `bun dev` to start the development server

### For AI Agents Building the Application

When implementing HRIStudio, follow this sequence:

1. **Start with Project Setup**
   - Use the Implementation Guide to set up the project structure
   - Follow the rules in `rules.txt` for coding standards
   - Reference the Project Overview for architectural decisions

2. **Implement Database Layer**
   - Use the Database Schema document to create all tables
   - Implement the schema files with Drizzle ORM
   - Set up relationships and indexes as specified

3. **Build API Layer**
   - Follow the API Routes document to implement all tRPC routes
   - Ensure proper authentication and authorization
   - Implement error handling and validation

4. **Create UI Components**
   - Reference Feature Requirements for UI specifications
   - Use shadcn/ui components exclusively
   - Follow the component patterns in Implementation Guide

5. **Add Real-time Features**
   - Implement WebSocket server for trial execution
   - Add real-time updates for wizard interface
   - Ensure proper state synchronization

6. **Implement Robot Integration**
   - Follow ROS2 Integration guide for robot plugins
   - Set up rosbridge on robot systems
   - Test WebSocket communication

7. **Deploy and Monitor**

## üìã Key Implementation Notes

### Architecture Principles
- **Modular Design**: Each feature is self-contained
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript with strict mode
- **Server-First**: Leverage React Server Components
- **Real-time**: WebSocket for live trial execution
- **Secure**: Role-based access control throughout

### Technology Choices
- **Next.js 15**: App Router for modern React patterns
- **tRPC**: Type-safe API communication
- **Drizzle ORM**: Type-safe database queries
- **NextAuth.js v5**: Authentication and authorization
- **shadcn/ui**: Consistent UI components
- **Cloudflare R2**: S3-compatible object storage
- **roslib.js**: WebSocket-based ROS2 communication
- **Vercel KV**: Edge-compatible caching (instead of Redis)

### Critical Features
1. **Visual Experiment Designer**: Drag-and-drop interface
2. **Wizard Interface**: Real-time control during trials
3. **Plugin System**: Extensible robot platform support
4. **Data Capture**: Comprehensive recording of all trial data
5. **Collaboration**: Multi-user support with role-based access

## üîß Development Workflow

2. Build Docker image
3. Run security scans
4. Deploy to staging
5. Run smoke tests
6. Deploy to production

## ü§ù Contributing Guidelines

### For AI Agents
- Always reference the documentation before implementing
- Follow the patterns established in the Implementation Guide
- Ensure all code follows the rules in `rules.txt`
- Implement comprehensive error handling
- Add proper TypeScript types for all code

### Code Quality Standards
- No `any` types in TypeScript
- All components must be accessible (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- API routes must have proper validation
- Database queries must be optimized
- Real-time features must handle disconnections

## üìû Support and Resources

### Documentation Updates
This documentation is designed to be comprehensive and self-contained. If you identify gaps or need clarification:
1. Check all related documents first
2. Look for patterns in the Implementation Guide
