- Duplicated validation logic
- Inconsistent UI patterns
- Scattered error handling
- Different loading states
- Varied navigation patterns

### **Solution Implemented**
**EntityForm Component**: A unified form infrastructure providing:

```typescript
interface EntityFormProps {
  mode: 'create' | 'edit';
  entityName: string;
  entityNamePlural: string;
  backUrl: string;
  listUrl: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  icon: React.ComponentType;
  form: UseFormReturn<any>;
  onSubmit: (data: any) => Promise<void>;
  isSubmitting: boolean;
  error: string | null;
  onDelete?: () => Promise<void>;
  isDeleting?: boolean;
  sidebar: React.ReactNode;
  children: React.ReactNode;
}
```

### **Key Features**
