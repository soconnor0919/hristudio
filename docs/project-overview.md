# HRIStudio Project Overview

## Executive Summary

HRIStudio is a web-based platform designed to standardize and improve the reproducibility of Wizard of Oz (WoZ) studies in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) research. The platform addresses critical challenges in HRI research by providing a comprehensive experimental workflow management system with standardized terminology, visual experiment design tools, real-time wizard control interfaces, and comprehensive data capture capabilities.
