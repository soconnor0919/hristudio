# Route Consolidation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive route consolidation work completed in September 2024, which transformed HRIStudio from a fragmented routing structure with duplicated global and study-specific views into a clean, study-scoped architecture.

## Problem Statement

### Issues with Original Architecture
- **Route Confusion**: Duplicate routes for participants (`/participants` and `/studies/[id]/participants`) and trials (`/trials` and `/studies/[id]/trials`)
- **Code Duplication**: Separate components for global and study-specific views with 90% overlapping functionality
- **Navigation Inconsistency**: Users confused about where to find functionality
- **Maintenance Burden**: Changes required updates to multiple similar components
- **Dashboard 404**: The `/dashboard` route was incorrectly configured and not accessible

### Technical Debt
- `participants-data-table.tsx` vs `ParticipantsTable.tsx`
- `trials-data-table.tsx` vs `TrialsTable.tsx`
- Inconsistent breadcrumb patterns
- Broken links in navigation dropdowns
- Multiple creation flows for the same entities

## Solution: Study-Scoped Architecture

### Design Principles
1. **Single Source of Truth**: One route and component per entity type
2. **Logical Hierarchy**: Studies as the primary organizational unit
3. **Consistent Navigation**: All entity management flows through studies
4. **User-Friendly Transitions**: Helpful redirects for moved functionality

### Final Route Structure

```
Global Routes (Platform-Level):
├── /dashboard                    # Overview across all user's studies
├── /studies                     # Study management hub
├── /profile                     # User account management
└── /admin                       # System administration

Study-Scoped Routes (All Study-Dependent Functionality):
├── /studies/[id]                # Study details and overview
├── /studies/[id]/participants   # Participant management for study
├── /studies/[id]/trials        # Trial management for study
├── /studies/[id]/experiments    # Experiment protocols for study
├── /studies/[id]/plugins       # Robot plugins for study
├── /studies/[id]/analytics     # Analytics for study
└── /studies/[id]/edit          # Study configuration

Individual Entity Routes (Preserved):
├── /trials/[trialId]           # Individual trial details
├── /trials/[trialId]/wizard    # Trial execution interface (TO BE BUILT)
├── /trials/[trialId]/analysis  # Trial data analysis
├── /experiments/[id]           # Individual experiment details
├── /experiments/[id]/edit      # Edit experiment
└── /experiments/[id]/designer  # Visual experiment designer

Helpful Redirect Routes (User-Friendly Transitions):
├── /participants               # Redirects to study selection
├── /trials                     # Redirects to study selection
├── /experiments                # Redirects to study selection
├── /plugins                    # Redirects to study selection
└── /analytics                  # Redirects to study selection
```

## Implementation Details

### 1. Complete Route Cleanup
**Converted to Study-Scoped Routes:**
- `/experiments` → `/studies/[id]/experiments`
- `/plugins` → `/studies/[id]/plugins`  
- `/plugins/browse` → `/studies/[id]/plugins/browse`

**Converted to Helpful Redirects:**
- `/participants` → Shows study selection guidance
- `/trials` → Shows study selection guidance
- `/experiments` → Shows study selection guidance  
- `/plugins` → Shows study selection guidance
- `/analytics` → Shows study selection guidance (already existed)

**Eliminated Duplicates:**
- Removed duplicate experiment creation routes
- Consolidated plugin management to study-scoped only
- Unified all study-dependent functionality under `/studies/[id]/`

### 2. Dashboard Route Fix
**Problem**: `/dashboard` was 404ing due to incorrect route group usage
**Solution**: Moved dashboard from `(dashboard)` route group to explicit `/dashboard` route

**Before:**
```
/app/(dashboard)/page.tsx  # Conflicted with /app/page.tsx for root route
```

**After:**
```
/app/dashboard/page.tsx    # Explicit /dashboard route
/app/dashboard/layout.tsx  # Uses existing (dashboard) layout
```

### 3. Helpful Redirect Pages
Created user-friendly redirect pages for moved routes:

**`/participants`** → Shows explanation and redirects to studies
**`/trials`** → Shows explanation and redirects to studies
**`/analytics`** → Shows explanation and redirects to studies

**Features:**
- Auto-redirect if user has selected study in context
- Clear explanation of new location
- Maintains dashboard layout with sidebar
- Action buttons to navigate to studies

### 4. Navigation Updates
**App Sidebar:**
- Removed global "Participants" and "Trials" navigation items
- Kept study-focused navigation structure

**Dashboard Quick Actions:**
- Updated to focus on study creation and browsing
- Removed broken links to non-existent routes

**Breadcrumbs:**
- Updated all entity forms to use study-scoped routes
- Fixed ParticipantForm and TrialForm navigation
- Consistent hierarchy: Dashboard → Studies → [Study] → [Entity]

### 5. Form and Component Updates
**ParticipantForm:**
- Updated all breadcrumb references to use study-scoped routes
- Fixed redirect after deletion to go to study participants
- Updated back/list URLs to be study-scoped

**TrialForm:**
- Similar updates to ParticipantForm
- Fixed navigation consistency

**Component Cleanup:**
- Removed unused imports (Users, TestTube icons)
- Fixed ESLint errors (apostrophe escaping)
- Removed duplicate functionality

### 6. Custom 404 Handling
**Created:** `/app/(dashboard)/not-found.tsx`
- Uses dashboard layout (sidebar intact)
- User-friendly error message
- Navigation options to recover
- Consistent with platform design

## Benefits Achieved

- **Working Links**: All navigation items point to valid routes
- **Responsive Design**: Layout works across different screen sizes

## Migration Guide

### For Users
1. **Bookmarks**: Update any bookmarks from global routes (`/experiments`, `/plugins`, etc.) to study-specific routes
2. **Workflow**: Access all study-dependent functionality through studies rather than global views
3. **Navigation**: Use sidebar study-aware navigation - select study context first, then access study-specific functionality
4. **Redirects**: Helpful guidance pages automatically redirect when study context is available

### For Developers
1. **Components**: Use study-scoped routes for all study-dependent functionality
2. **Routing**: All study-dependent entity links should go through `/studies/[id]/` structure
3. **Forms**: Use study-scoped back/redirect URLs  
4. **Navigation**: Sidebar automatically shows study-dependent items when study is selected
5. **Context**: Components automatically receive study context through URL parameters
