# HRIStudio Seed Script Documentation

## Overview

The HRIStudio seed script (`scripts/seed-dev.ts`) provides a comprehensive development database with realistic test data for all major entities in the system. This script is designed to give developers and testers a fully functional environment with diverse scenarios to work with.

## Quick Start

Run the seed script with:

```bash
bun run db:seed
```

**Note**: This script will completely clean the database before seeding new data.
