# Work In Progress

## Current Status (December 2024)

### Experiment Designer Redesign - COMPLETE ‚úÖ (Phase 1)
Initial redesign delivered per `docs/experiment-designer-redesign.md`. Continuing iterative UX/scale refinement (Phase 2).

> Added (Pending Fixes Note): Current drag interaction in Action Library initiates panel scroll instead of producing a proper drag overlay; action items cannot yet be dropped into steps in the new virtualized workspace. Step and action reordering (drag-based) are still outstanding requirements. Action pane collapse toggle was removed (overlapped breadcrumbs). Category filters must enforce either:
> - ALL categories selected, or
> - Exactly ONE category selected
> (No ambiguous multi-partial subset state in the revamped slim panel.)

#### **Implementation Status (Phase 1 Recap)**

**‚úÖ Core Infrastructure Complete:**
- Zustand state management with comprehensive actions and selectors
- Deterministic SHA-256 hashing with incremental computation
- Type-safe validation (structural, parameter, semantic, execution)
- Plugin drift detection with action signature tracking
- Export/import integrity bundles

**‚úÖ UI Components (Initial Generation):**
- `DesignerShell` (initial orchestration ‚Äì now superseded by `DesignerRoot`)
- `ActionLibrary` (v1 palette)
- `StepFlow` (legacy list)
- `PropertiesPanel`, `ValidationPanel`, `DependencyInspector`
- `SaveBar`

**Phase 2 Overhaul Components (In Progress / Added):**
- `DesignerRoot` (panel + status bar orchestration)
- `PanelsContainer` (resizable/collapsible left/right)
- `BottomStatusBar` (hash / drift / unsaved quick actions)
- `ActionLibraryPanel` (slim, single-column, favorites, density, search)
- `FlowWorkspace` (virtualized step list replacing `StepFlow` for large scale)
- `InspectorPanel` (tabbed: properties / issues / dependencies)

### Recent Updates (Latest Iteration)

**Action Library Slim Refactor**
- Constrained width (max 240px) with internal vertical scroll
- Single-column tall tiles; star (favorite) moved top-right
- Multi-line name wrapping; description line-clamped (3 lines)
- Stacked control layout (search ‚Üí categories ‚Üí compact buttons)
- Eliminated horizontal scroll-on-drag issue (prevented unintended X scroll)
- Removed responsive two-column to preserve predictable drag targets

**Scroll / Drag Fixes**
- Explicit `overflow-y-auto overflow-x-hidden` on action list container
- Prevented accidental horizontal scroll on drag start
- Ensured tiles use minimal horizontal density to preserve central workspace

**Flow Pane Overhaul**
- Introduced `FlowWorkspace` virtualized list:
  - Variable-height virtualization (dynamic measurement with ResizeObserver)
  - Inline step rename (Enter / Escape / blur commit)
  - Collapsible steps with action chips
  - Insert ‚ÄúBelow‚Äù & ‚ÄúStep Above‚Äù affordances
  - Droppable targets registered per step (`step-<id>`)
  - Quick action placeholder insertion button
- Legacy `FlowListView` retained temporarily for fallback (to be removed)
- Step & action selection preserved (integrates with existing store)
- Drag-end adaptation for action insertion works with new virtualization

**Panel Layout & Status**
- `PanelsContainer` persists widths; action panel now narrower by design
- Status bar provides unified save / export / validate with state badges

### Migration Status

| Legacy Element | Status | Notes |
| -------------- | ------ | ----- |
| DesignerShell  | ‚úÖ Removed | Superseded by DesignerRoot |
| StepFlow       | ‚úÖ Removed | Superseded by FlowWorkspace |

### Upcoming (Phase 2 Roadmap)

1. Step Reordering in `FlowWorkspace` (drag handle integration)
2. Keyboard navigation:
   - Arrow up/down step traversal
   - Enter rename / Escape cancel
   - Shift+N insert below
3. Multi-select & bulk delete (steps + actions)
4. Command Palette (‚åòK):
   - Insert action by fuzzy search
   - Jump to step/action
   - Trigger validate / export / save
5. Graph / Branch View (React Flow selective mount)
6. Drift reconciliation modal (signature diff + adopt / ignore)
7. Auto-save throttle controls (status bar menu)
8. Server-side validation / compile endpoint integration (tRPC mutation)
9. Conflict resolution modal (hash drift vs persisted)
10. ‚úÖ Removal of legacy components completed (BlockDesigner, DesignerShell, StepFlow, ActionLibrary, SaveBar, FlowListView)
11. Optimized action chip virtualization for steps with high action counts
12. Inline parameter quick-edit popovers (for simple scalar params)

### Adjusted Immediate Tasks

| # | Task | Status |
| - | ---- | ------ |
| 1 | Slim action pane + scroll fix | ‚úÖ Complete |
| 2 | Introduce virtualized FlowWorkspace | ‚úÖ Initial implementation |
| 3 | Migrate page to `DesignerRoot` | ‚úÖ Complete |
| 4 | Hook drag-drop into new workspace | ‚úÖ Complete |
| 5 | Step reorder (drag) | ‚è≥ Pending |
| 6 | Command palette | ‚è≥ Pending |
| 7 | Remove legacy `StepFlow` & `FlowListView` | ‚è≥ After reorder |
| 8 | Graph view toggle | ‚è≥ Planned |
| 9 | Drift reconciliation UX | ‚è≥ Planned |
| 10 | Conflict resolution modal | ‚è≥ Planned |

### Known Issues

Current (post-overhaul):
- Dragging an action from the Action Library currently causes the list to scroll (drag overlay not isolated); drop into steps intermittently fails
- Step reordering not yet implemented in `FlowWorkspace` (parity gap with legacy StepFlow)
- Action reordering within a step not yet supported in `FlowWorkspace`
- Action chips may overflow visually for extremely large action counts in one step (virtualization of actions not yet applied)
- Quick Action button inserts placeholder ‚Äúcontrol‚Äù action (needs proper action selection / palette)
- No keyboard shortcuts integrated for new workspace yet
- Legacy components still present (technical debt until removal)
- Drag hover feedback minimal (no highlight state on step while hovering)
- No diff UI for drifted action signatures (placeholder toasts only)
- Category filter logic needs enforcement: either all categories selected OR exactly one (current multi-select subset state will be removed)
- Left action pane collapse button removed (was overlapping breadcrumbs); needs optional alternative placement if reintroduced

### Technical Notes

Virtualization Approach:
- Maintains per-step dynamic height map (ResizeObserver)
- Simple windowing (top/height + overscan) adequate for current scale
- Future performance: batch measurement and optional fixed-row mode fallback

Action Insertion:
- Drag from library ‚Üí step droppable ID
- Inline Quick Action path uses placeholder until palette arrives

State Integrity:
- Virtualization purely visual; canonical order & mutation operations remain in store (no duplication)

### Documentation To Update (Queued)
- `implementation-details.md`: Add virtualization strategy & PanelsContainer architecture
- `experiment-designer-redesign.md`: Append Phase 2 evolution section
- `quick-reference.md`: New shortcuts & panel layout (pending keyboard work)
- Remove references to obsolete `DesignerShell` post-cleanup

### Next Execution Batch (Planned)
1. Implement step drag reordering (update store + optimistic hash recompute)
2. Keyboard navigation & shortcuts foundation
3. Command palette scaffold (providers + fuzzy index)
4. Legacy component removal & doc synchronization


1. ‚úÖ **Step Addition**: Fixed - JSX structure and type imports resolved
2. ‚úÖ **Core Action Loading**: Fixed - Added missing "events" category to ActionRegistry

### Unified Study Selection System (Completed)

The platform previously had two parallel mechanisms for tracking the active study (`useActiveStudy` and `study-context`). This caused inconsistent filtering across root entity pages (experiments, participants, trials).

**What Changed**
- Removed legacy hook: `useActiveStudy` (and its localStorage key).
- Unified on: `study-context` (key: `hristudio-selected-study`).
- Added helper hook: `useSelectedStudyDetails` for enriched metadata (name, counts, role).
- Updated all study‚Äëscoped root pages and tables:
  - `/experiments` ‚Üí now strictly filtered server-side via `experiments.list(studyId)`
  - `/studies/[id]/participants` + `/studies/[id]/trials` ‚Üí set `selectedStudyId` from route param
  - `ExperimentsTable`, `ParticipantsTable`, `TrialsTable` ‚Üí consume `selectedStudyId`
- Normalized `TrialsTable` mapping to the actual `trials.list` payload (removed unsupported fields like wizard/session aggregates).
- Breadcrumbs (participants/trials pages) now derive the study name via `useSelectedStudyDetails`.

**Benefits**
- Single source of truth for active study
- Elimination of state drift between pages
- Reduced query invalidation complexity
- Clearer contributor mental model

**Follow‚ÄëUp (Optional)**
1. Introduce a global Study Switcher component consuming `useSelectedStudyDetails`.
2. Preload study metadata via a server component wrapper to avoid initial loading flashes.
3. Extend `trials.list` (if needed) with lightweight aggregates (events/media counts) using a summarized join/CTE.
4. Consolidate repeated breadcrumb patterns into a shared utility.

This unification completes the study selection refactor and stabilizes per‚Äëstudy scoping across the application.
